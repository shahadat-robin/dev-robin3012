### üêº About Me:

A passionate Software Engineer, currently working at [Lemon Hive](https://www.lemonhive.com). With a strong foundation in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I specialize in building modern, scalable, and user-centric web applications.

I have hands-on experience across the full frontend spectrum, with a keen eye for detail and focus on user experiences, writing clean, maintainable code. I‚Äôve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. I‚Äôm also comfortable working on the backend when needed, giving me the versatility to contribute across the stack.

I thrive in Agile environments and value collaboration, continuous learning, and creative problem-solving. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and push my skills to the next level ‚Äî blending both creative thinking and logical precision in everything I build.
